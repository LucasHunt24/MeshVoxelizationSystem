# **MeshVoxelizationSystem**

## **Description**  
MeshVoxelizationSystem is a cutting-edge software framework designed to process and render 3D mesh objects into voxelized grids. Originally developed for advanced modeling and simulation in game engines, this system efficiently converts complex 3D geometries into voxel representations for optimized computation and rendering.

Unfortunately, elements of this system have been illegally adapted for use in unauthorized game cheats, including cheats such as wallhacks and ESP (Extra Sensory Perception). These unauthorized adaptations exploit the core functionalities of this system, enabling unfair gameplay advantages by revealing player positions and objects within a game environment.  

The software, its algorithms, and its outputs are protected under copyright law, and any unauthorized use—including the creation or distribution of game cheats—is a direct violation of these protections.

## **Proof of Authorship**  
The MeshVoxelizationSystem was developed by Lucas Hunt, with the first version created on **February 7, 2023**. The source code, algorithms, and unique rendering techniques were exclusively authored by Lucas Hunt.  

Evidence of authorship includes:
1. **Original Publication Date**: February 7, 2023.  
2. **Hosted Repository**: This repository serves as the original and official source of the MeshVoxelizationSystem codebase.  
3. **Unique Identifiers**: The code contains proprietary algorithms and features identifiable in the infringing material, such as:  
   - Optimized voxelization routines for mesh geometries.  
   - Specialized rendering pipelines for 3D object visualization.  

**Timestamps and Metadata**: All files in this repository, including their creation and modification dates, serve as verifiable proof of authorship.

## **Cheats Misuse Documentation**  
It has come to our attention that the algorithms and outputs of MeshVoxelizationSystem have been misappropriated in game cheats, such as wallhacks and ESP overlays. These cheats exploit the following unique features of the system:
1. **Rendering Overlays**: Adapted from the voxel rendering pipeline to create visible outlines of in-game objects.  
2. **3D Scanning Techniques**: Used to display player positions through walls and other obstacles.
